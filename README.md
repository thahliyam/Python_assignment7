# Python_assignment7
This notebook contains a series of exercises designed to help users build proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas. The exercises start with basic tasks such as creating and reshaping NumPy arrays, where users learn to generate arrays with specific ranges of numbers and perform reshaping operations to convert a one-dimensional array into a multi-dimensional matrix. The notebook then progresses to data slicing, where users practice extracting specific elements from arrays using indexing. In the Pandas section, users are introduced to creating and modifying Series, which are one-dimensional labeled data structures. They also learn how to add new items to an existing Series. The notebook moves on to demonstrate how to create DataFrames—two-dimensional tabular data structures—and how to manipulate them by adding new columns, such as occupation. Additionally, users are taught how to filter DataFrame rows based on certain conditions, such as selecting rows where the age is greater than or equal to 30. Finally, the exercises cover how to save the DataFrame as a CSV file and how to read that file back into a DataFrame, offering a practical approach to data persistence and sharing. This comprehensive set of exercises is designed to provide a solid foundation in handling arrays, Series, and DataFrames—core components in any data analysis workflow—while also emphasizing the importance of efficiently managing and manipulating data.
